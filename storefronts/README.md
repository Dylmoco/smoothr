# storefronts

Client-facing storefront code and widgets.

This package contains the core storefront modules located in `./core`.

The bundled SDK is designed for zeroâ€‘config installation on platforms like
Webflow. Simply include

```html
<script type="module" src="https://sdk.smoothr.io/smoothr-sdk.js"></script>
```

and authentication will initialize automatically.

Create a `.env` file in this directory and provide your Supabase project details:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

An `.env.example` file is included for reference.

## Core modules

### Usage

```javascript
import * as core from './core/index.js';

core.discounts; // example access
```

## Running tests

Run `npm install` once before executing the test suite to ensure all dependencies are available.

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

`npm test` also triggers a `pretest` step that installs dependencies automatically if needed.
